# FST-LunchApp

# Idea
Inspired by the Japanese working culture I felt exited to build an app that encourages colleagues to embrace their community with their colleagues more throughly. Therefore, the central focus of this app is to organize Lunchtime in social groups. The app aims to make communication especially in big corporate companys with hundrets of workers much more convenient. It achieves this by offering an easy way to create events during lunchtime and spread them around all colleagues, which can, then, participate in a wide range of events.

# Stack
The central core is a Flutter App running on both IOs and Android. The backend is constructed fully by funcitons of Google's Firebase. Those components are Authentification, Firestore, Firebase Messaging, Cloud Functions as well as Distributing. Further makes the App use of the Google Maps and Places API.

# Security
User Data is secured by using Firebase Rules to restrict access on foreign user's database entries. Also writing access to other peoples events is forbidden expect the participant list, where the user can only add himself.
