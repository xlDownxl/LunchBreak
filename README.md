# FST-LunchApp

# Idea
The central focus of this app is to organize Lunchtime in social groups. The idea stems from my time in Japan, where i was inspired by the fixed time of lunchbreaks and the lacking social interaction during the whole work day. 

# Stack
The central core is a Flutter app running on both IOs and Android. Backend functionality, database, security as well as distribution are all done with Firebase.
